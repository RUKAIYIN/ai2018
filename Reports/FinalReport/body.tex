\section{Introduction}

The first goal of the assignment was to design and implement a negotiation agent to negotiate for us the best possible arrangement in a party-throwing negotiation session. Of course the final goal was that our agent could negotiate on all possible negotiation domain and even under uncertainty. In order to achieve that, we had to use the BOA framework which is a simple way of representing an agent through individual components (Bidding strategy, Opponent model, Acceptance strategy). In order to know how good our agent performs, we have to test it against all other agent of the assignment and compare these results to the expected one.

\section{Structure of the party}

See google doc for a draft of what it's supposed to look like

\section{Explanations}

\subsection{Negotiation strategy}

Can reuse assignment 2 on bidding strategy (if that's what they meant by ``negotiation strategy''. 

\subsection{decision function for accepting offers}

Can reuse assignment 1 and 2, first acceptance strategy then modification. Did we do modification ?

\subsection{preparatory steps}

How we initialize everything ?

\subsection{Heuristics}

Opponent model Heuristic
Something else ?
